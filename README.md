# Away days 
A joint project by Edward Cowell and Jack Mckelvey. 

## What is away days? 

Away days is a stadium tracker. A full stack project with a custom built API in the backend. Away days lets you search for all premier league stadiums in England. With a dedicated stadium page you can get details of the chosen stadium, with google maps showing the location and surrounding pubs. Each stadium has comments attached which allow users to rate the stadium on transport, value for money and the local pubs. This is then calculated into an overall average for all stadiums. 

It is fully responsive and can work on all platforms.
